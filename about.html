    <p>&ldquo;I never set out to direct, I thought my place was on a stage. I didn't plan on starting a production company, I just love bringing people together. I love my sisters, but always wanted a brother. Now I have two. We tell stories that need to be told, and they take us to unexpected, incredible places to meet ordinary, incredible people - and now their stories have become ours.&rdquo;</p>
